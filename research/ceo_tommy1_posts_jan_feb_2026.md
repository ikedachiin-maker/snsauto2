**Topic**: Synthetic Video x Outreach - The 2026 Answer for Sales

**Full text (reconstructed from search snippets)**:

This is Tommy's "study memo" of latest business trends acquired from overseas entrepreneur communities. The post discusses how sales outreach methods have evolved from images to AI-generated videos.

Key points covered:
- Story of Guillaume Moubeche (Paris, started experiment in 2018): sent personalized emails with photos of himself holding whiteboards with recipients' names written on them. Built lemlist, which grew to approximately 230 billion yen valuation over 3 years without external capital.
- In 2026, this method evolved from photos to "Synthetic Video" - AI-generated personalized videos embedded in sales emails.
- HeyGen and Tavus now perfectly support Japanese pronunciation in 2026 updates.
- In the US B2B/High Ticket industry, "Synthetic Video" embedding in sales emails increases click-through rates 5-8x compared to standard emails.
- 2025 data shows typical cold email response rates are around 0.1% (1 reply per 1000 emails).
- Generic video gets ~5% playback rate, but personalized video containing the recipient's name achieves 70%+ playback rate (leveraging the "cocktail party effect" - humans automatically respond to hearing their own names).
- In Japan, only 1% of companies are implementing this video outreach method seriously, presenting a massive competitive opportunity.
- Contrasts two traditional Japanese sales methods: mass distribution (mail magazine/LINE steps) vs manual outreach (telemarketing/DMs). Synthetic Video bridges the gap.
- The challenge is creating effective personalized video scripts at scale.
- This is described as "the 2026 answer" for people struggling with outreach and sales.

**Topic**: Notion Templates x Content Waterfall - How to Make 20 Billion Yen/Year Working 4 Hours/Day

**Full text (reconstructed from search snippets)**:

Another "study memo" of latest business trends obtained overseas. Discusses Matt Gray's business model.

Key points covered:
- Matt Gray (Founder OS) makes approximately 20 billion yen annually by "selling Notion templates" while working only 4 hours per day.
- He proposes a framework called "Content Waterfall" (content cascade/waterfall).
- The framework: Create one high-quality "parent content" piece (e.g., YouTube video or newsletter) about once per week.
- That single piece gets broken down and re-edited into 25+ smaller content pieces distributed across X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Instagram, and short-form videos.
- Key principle: "Don't think of new topics every day" but "use one asset in different forms."
- This system minimizes customer acquisition costs while maintaining a large revenue-generating ecosystem.
- Addresses how to break through the "10 million yen annual revenue ceiling" - the answer is systems, not more personal labor time.

**Topic**: Trend Arbitrage - The Steph Smith Story & Future Prediction via Google's Bug

**Full text (reconstructed from search snippets)**:

This is one of Tommy's most detailed posts. Key points covered:

Opening thesis:
- "The most foolish act in business is making efforts in a place where you don't know if there's demand. Conversely, the smartest act is finding a place where customers are lining up but there's no store."

Main story - Steph Smith:
- A 27-year-old unemployed woman (former nomadic blogger from Canada who traveled the world writing travel stories and life lessons) sold "just a URL collection" for 100 million yen.
- She exploited what Tommy calls a "Google bug" - a method of "future prediction."
- Despite having no access initially, no earnings, and only her mother's single "like" on her blog, she built a massive business.
- This is framed as a story from Silicon Valley that Japanese people haven't noticed yet.

Theory - Trend Arbitrage:
- The gap between "Volume: High / Difficulty: Low" (high demand but low supply) is the essence of "trend arbitrage."
- Examples: If you could have published content about the sauna boom, MBTI personality typing, or Chocozap (convenience gym chain) BEFORE they exploded, you'd have massive first-mover advantage.
- In 2026, AI-generated articles have flooded "medium-difficulty keywords" - humans can only compete in "the latest gaps" that AI hasn't yet learned.
- "Trend arbitrage" is theoretically the strongest strategy, but it's physically impossible for humans to execute manually because the flow of information in 2026 is too fast and data volumes are too large.
- Using general-purpose AI tools like ChatGPT won't help find these opportunities either.

Research method:
- Discusses concrete research techniques for identifying market gaps with zero competitors (positioning in a "zero competition" space).

**Topic**: The Overwork Survivor Who Makes 600M Yen/Year Selling His Struggles - The King Model

**Full text (reconstructed from search snippets)**:

Title/hook: "A man on the brink of overwork death sold his troubles and made 600 million yen annually. The true identity of the 'King Model' that dominates all SNS."

Key points covered:

Target audience call-out:
- Aimed at people who are undecided about what to share online ("can't decide what genre to post about")
- People who feel they lack impressive achievements ("have no achievements to boast about")

Main concept:
- A person with "no specialized knowledge, no special skills, working on client work to the brink of overwork death" achieved 600 million yen in annual revenue through content business.
- Discusses a market concept where "you can make billions just by living."
- Content business has minimal fixed costs and zero replication costs.
- This is information obtained from overseas entrepreneurial circles as study notes on the latest business trends.

The "King Model" / "Creator Flywheel" strategy:
- Write ONE long-form blog post on weekends.
- Create a YouTube video by reading the blog text aloud.
- Break the video/text into 5-6 parts for X posts and threads.
- Extract key phrases to create Instagram graphics/visual diagrams.
- This allows one piece of writing to fill ALL SNS timelines simultaneously ("dominate all SNS").

"AIトミーくん使ってサクッと850万。あの時代のローンチマーケターで●十億と売ってきた方から。やはりAIトミーくんは生粋の商材屋と相性が良い。「昔は年商●億のローンチ屋だったのに最近ダメなんだよな...」という先輩方、AIトミーくんで人生取り戻しませんか？（このオファー億売れそうw）"

Translation: "Made a quick 8.5 million yen using AI Tommy. From someone who sold tens of billions as a launch marketer back in the day. AI Tommy really is compatible with pure info-product sellers. 'I used to be a launch operator making billions annually but lately things aren't working...' - to those seniors, want to reclaim your life with AI Tommy? (This offer could sell hundreds of millions lol)"

"ローンチからわずか48時間で5億円以上を売り上げ、ARR換算で $639M（約970億円）を達成。ブロックチェーン上で自分のドラッグ工場を作る「Addicted」というゲームリリースまでの軌跡を綴ったnoteが面白かった。ゲーム自体も面白そう。"

Translation: "Over 500 million yen in sales within just 48 hours of launch, achieving $639M (~97 billion yen) in ARR. The note documenting the journey to releasing 'Addicted,' a game where you build your own drug factory on the blockchain, was fascinating. The game itself looks interesting too."

"実は9割の人が知らないローンチ手法「Cローンチ」というものがある。リサーチした限り私以外に1社だけ使っている（他社はエバーで月商7000万）この手法は「情弱狩り専用で教育なし」だがなぜか売れる。この手法を知りたい人いますか？いたら「いいねポチ」で教えてください。企画化検討します。"

Translation: "There's actually a launch method called 'C-Launch' that 90% of people don't know about. From my research, only one other company besides me uses it (they do 70 million yen/month with evergreen). This method is 'exclusively for targeting the uninformed, no education needed' but somehow it sells. Anyone want to know this method? If so, hit 'like' and let me know. I'll consider turning it into a program."

"AIトミーくんはリスト数1700、売上4700万（年始で5000超えた）、1ローンチのLTV2.64万だっけな。なんかぼちぼちの数字だったけど、7日でセールスレターを書き上げた。教育も動画も布石もLINEもない。でも1日中ゲームしてサボってたせいで時間かかったとは口が避けても言えない。"

Translation: "AI Tommy has 1,700 lists, 47 million yen in sales (exceeded 50 million at New Year's), LTV per launch of about 26,400 yen. Those are decent numbers, and I wrote the sales letter in 7 days. No education, no videos, no foreshadowing, no LINE. But I can't exactly say out loud that it took time because I was slacking off playing games all day."

Translation: "I earned 11 million yen in 2 months on note, but earned 75 million yen in 2 months on Park, so the era belongs to Park."

Translation: "I'm progressing on converting into knowledge the entire school that produced someone who earned 1 billion yen from my past sales - feeding it all to AI. Materials are ready: 130+ videos, dozens of PDFs, and a dedicated email newsletter. I'll complete AI Tommy and move to the next dimension. First, fully automate step emails and sales letters with AI. Food to feed AI (knowledge)."
